# CVE Report Generator

## Project Description
This tool utilizes data from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), a U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). The script automates the process of fetching vulnerability information, providing security measurement, and ensuring compliance by integrating with the NVD API.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure `jq` and `curl` are installed on your system. If not, install them using your package manager (`brew` for macOS, `apt` for Debian-based systems, etc.).
   - Download or clone the script into your project directory.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Ensure your project has a `package-lock.json` file with dependencies listed.

3. **Execution:**
   - Open a terminal.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the script (`cd path/to/script`).
   - Run the script using `./script_name.sh`.
   - Follow the prompts to enter the project path and let the script generate the HTML report.

4. **Output:**
   - After execution, the script will create an `cve_report.html` file in the script's directory, containing a detailed CVE risk report for your project dependencies.
