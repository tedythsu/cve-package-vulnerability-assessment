Project Description:
Developed a comprehensive script to generate an HTML report of CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) risks for software dependencies. This tool utilizes data from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), a U.S. government repository of standards-based vulnerability management data represented using the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP). The script automates the process of fetching vulnerability information, providing security measurement, and ensuring compliance by integrating with the NVD API.

Key Features:

Dependency Analysis: Extracts dependencies and their versions from the package-lock.json file.
API Integration: Utilizes the NVD API to fetch vulnerability data for each dependency.
Retry Logic: Implements a robust retry mechanism to handle intermittent API request failures.
HTML Report Generation: Creates a detailed HTML report summarizing the vulnerabilities, including CVE IDs, published dates, severity scores, and descriptions.
Automated Handling: Ensures the report is up-to-date by running through all dependencies and presenting an organized, easy-to-read table format.
Technologies Used:

Bash scripting
jq for JSON parsing
curl for API requests
HTML for report formatting
Impact:
Enhanced the ability to manage and mitigate security risks by automating the detection and reporting of vulnerabilities in project dependencies, aiding in maintaining secure and compliant software environments.
